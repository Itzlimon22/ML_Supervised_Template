💡 Best Practices

Always save models after training; never commit raw model files to GitHub.

Save scalers/encoders used in preprocessing to ensure reproducibility.

Keep EDA and evaluation figures in reports/figures/ to document analysis.

Maintain model_comparison.csv to track experiments and choose best models.
